## Design Overview

In this project, I used Figma to create high-fidelity designs for both mobile and desktop versions. Below is a preview showcasing the `Design System` and the prototyping process conducted in Figma:

## Description

The primary goal of this project is to apply React skills to create a web application platform.
It integrates modern web development techniques and tools to improve both user experience (UX) and code quality.

## Key Features and Technologies

- CSS framework: Use `Tailwind` CSS for utility-first design, enabling faster design implementation and responsive design.
- REST API: Implements CRUD API features, primarily focusing on GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests for working with required data.
- TypeScript: The code is written strongly-typed using `TypeScript`, lowering the chance of bugs, obtaining a better code quality, and improving the DX (`Developer Experience`).
- React Topics: `functional components`, `component composition`, `useState`, `useEffect`, `AbortController`, `custom hooks` and `UseContext`.
- Routing: `react-router-dom 6.x` with custom `Error Boundary`.
- Strongly Typed Forms: Using `Yup` and `react-hook-form` to manage user validation and proper user feedback, and strongly typed.
- Unit Testing and Browser Testing: Using `vitest` (`Jest` compatible) to implement browser testing (Playwright) to automate the correctness of the Authentication forms.
- Global State Management: `UseContext` for managing user data and preventing prop drilling.
- Storage: `Local Storage` to store application state, such as user data and token, ensuring data persistence across page reloads and browser sessions.
- SEO: Enhanced with `Helmet` async package, for dynamic custom titles and descriptions for each page.
- Environment Variables: Use `.env` to avoid to expose sensitive data.

- Javascript/TypeScript Techniques:

  - Array functions: `filter`, `map`, `Array.from`, `entries`, `findIndex`, `includes`, `sort` and `reduce`.
  - Destructuring for cleaner code
  - Development Tools: Uses `Vite` as a bundler and follows a streamlined workflow with tools like `Eslint` and `Prettier`.

### Calendar Implementation

For the booking functionality in the Holidaze Booking app, I integrate a custom calendar using the [`@demark-pro/react-booking-calendar`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@demark-pro/react-booking-calendar) package.
This calendar allows users to book only the available dates for a venue, based on the required number of guests, finalizing the booking accordingly.

#### Evaluation Process

Before selecting this package, I followed these steps to ensure it met the necessary standards for integration into the project:

1. Documentation: I reviewed the package's documentation to ensure it was clear and easy to understand.
2. Downloads: I checked the number of weekly downloads to gauge the package's popularity and reliability.
3. Support & Maintenance: I evaluated the ongoing support by reviewing the Issues tab to confirm that open issues were being addressed in a timely manner, and checked the last update to ensure the package was still actively maintained.
4. Fallback Plan: In case the package is discontinued, I ensured it had a relatively stable codebase and could be easily replaced with an alternative if necessary.

By following these steps, I was able to choose a package that fits the needs of the project while ensuring long-term reliability.

- Customizable Booking Calendar: The calendar provides an intuitive interface for users to select booking dates.
- Availability Management: Dates are displayed based on the Venue's availability, helping users easily identify when a Venue is available.
- Responsive Design: The calendar is optimized for both mobile and desktop views, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

You can find the package documentation and additional configuration options [here](https://github.com/demark-pro/react-booking-calendar#readme).

### Testing

Tests were not required for this project. However I have implemented unit tests for the authentications form to ensure the correct functionality.

- Unit Testing:

  - Implement `vitest` for testing authentication form components and API calls ensuring each piece works as expected.

### Development Practices

- Responsive Design: Ensures optimal user experience across devices using media queries.
- Code Quality: Follows `DRY principles` (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) for structured and maintainable code.
- Developer Tools: Utilizes tools such as `VS code`, `DevTools`, `GitHub`, and `Postman` for development and testing.
- Code Validation: Employs validation tools to ensure standards compliance.
- Mobile First: The design prioritizes mobile responsiveness, ensuring an optimal experience on mobile devices before adapting to large.

### Code Organization

- Components with single responsibility and Reusable, following this pattern the application is split into smaller composable components.
- Folder Structure: The project follows `Vertical Slices` approach organizing the code by feature.

- UX improvements:

  - Accessibility: Implement `WCAG` (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards for improved user accessibility.
  - Navigation & Structure: Use semantic `HTML`, ARIA labels, and Tailwind focus utilities to improve navigation, structure, accessibility, and user experience (UX).
  - Design: Implement custom fonts, a consistent color palette, and reusable components like headers and VenueCards for a cohesive look.
  - Responsive Design: Optimize booking calendar and layouts for both desktop and mobile users.
  - User Flow: Simplified authentication with tabs for login and registration, plus a dedicated manager registration process.
  - Interactive Features: Add a booking confirmation modal and hover effects for improved feedback and engagement.
  - Planning: Design user flows in Figma and managed tasks via GitHub Projects for a streamlined development process.

## Additional Information

While the course assignment required JavaScript, I chose to use `TypeScript` to enhance code quality.
This decision allows for strongly typed code and establishes clear API data contracts, improving maintainability and reducing potential errors.

## API

The application interacts with the Holidaze Booking API.
The API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2).
API Routes: The API requires both a JWT token and an API Key but does not require authentication for the home page and Venue detail pages.

## Feature implemented

- a `guest` user can:

  - accesses the site without authentication
  - view a list of Venues
  - browse and search for specific Venue
  - view specific Venue details
  - view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
  - a user with a `@stud.noroff.no` email can register as a `customer` or a `manager`

- a `customer` user can:

  - log in to book a Venue
  - view their upcoming bookings
  - update their profile, such as their avatar
  - log out from their account

- a `manager` user can:

  - log in to create, update or delete Venues they manage
  - view bookings for a Venue they manage
  - update their profile, such as their avatar
  - log out of their account

## Validation

The web application code has been validated using the following tools:

- [check html validity](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [check css validity](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [check redirect links](https://validator.w3.org/checklink)
- [check accessibility](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/)
